# RigWorks

![The geometry vocabulary — examples/minimal-scene.json drawn by the repo's own SVG fulfillment](site/scene.svg)

**A no-code creative application framework.**  
*Because no code is the best code.*

RigWorks — **Rig** for short, and Rig in all running text — is a shared data vocabulary for creative applications. It is a framework you never install — no library to link, no runtime to embed, no API to version. It ships as agreement: two loop rules and a shared vocabulary. Apps that speak the same schema ids share fields and units, so their content interoperates without either app knowing the other exists.

## It runs

A Rig document is not a diagram of a format. The same schemas compile to a playable cartridge for PICO-8 — a console we did not write, which has never heard of Rig. That fulfillment lives in [PicoForge](https://github.com/GitBruno/PicoForge): converters, cart documents, and showcase games. The cart's `_init` / `_update` / `_draw` **are** the SUDE loop. Palette, tiles, map, input, and music travel as `rig.pixel.*`, `rig.input.*`, and `rig.music.*` components.

**Concept is more important than execution.** What a transform *is* outlives every renderer that ever drew one. Rig keeps the concept and leaves the execution to you — [why no code](docs/why-no-code.md).

**AI co-coding is here to stay.** When execution gets cheap, the shared concept becomes the scarce asset. Rig publishes it in a form people and models read the same way — [AI collaboration](docs/ai-collaboration.md).

**What it costs.** A data framework moves work rather than deleting it. You write the loop; nothing fails to build when you drift; a schema only pays off once a second host speaks it — [the honest price](docs/why-no-code.md#the-honest-price).

## The framework

1. **Rules** — [SUDE](docs/sude.md) (Setup / Update / Draw / Exit) and [ECS](docs/ecs.md). Enough to **be Rig**.
2. **Schemas** — agreed POD field layouts ([prose](schemas/) + [JSON Schema](schemas/json/)). Ship what you support.
3. **Properties** — portable [datatype](docs/properties.md) rows.
4. **Optional UI** — [Rig + UI](docs/ui.md) editing the same data.

Words used precisely — Contract, fulfillment, host, pack: [docs/terms.md](docs/terms.md).

Wire format is **JSON** ([`rig.document`](schemas/document.md)). Validate generated output:

```bash
npm run setup                                          # once — installs the validator
node tools/rig-validate/cli.js examples/minimal-scene.json
npm run check                                          # schemas, parity, links, reference documents
```

## Worked example

Hosts run a SUDE loop; portable content is ECS components on entities:

```text
Setup  → spawn / load entities
Update → simulate (modulators, transport, …)
Draw   → present
Exit   → tear down
```

One entity in Contract JSON ([`examples/minimal-scene.json`](examples/minimal-scene.json)):

<!-- rig:begin entity=demo-rect from=examples/minimal-scene.json -->
```json
{
  "id": "demo-rect",
  "components": {
    "rig.meta.named": {
      "name": "demo-rect",
      "stableId": "demo-rect"
    },
    "rig.spatial.transform": {
      "position": [
        20,
        65,
        0
      ],
      "rotation": [
        0,
        0,
        0,
        1
      ],
      "scale": [
        1,
        1,
        1
      ]
    },
    "rig.geometry.rectangle": {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 140,
      "height": 90,
      "cornerRadius": 10
    },
    "rig.paint.fill_stroke": {
      "fillRgba": [
        0.25,
        0.65,
        1,
        1
      ]
    },
    "rig.interact.selectable": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## For AI agents

Load the condensed skill before generating Rig data: [`skills/generating-rig-documents/SKILL.md`](skills/generating-rig-documents/SKILL.md). Cross-agent onboarding: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Discovery index: [`llms.txt`](llms.txt). Why the repo is shaped this way: [`docs/ai-collaboration.md`](docs/ai-collaboration.md).

Always validate emission:

```bash
node tools/rig-validate/cli.js path/to/doc.json
```

## Reference host

[RigKit](https://github.com/rigkid/RigKit) fulfills Rig on desktop (GLFW / OpenGL / packs). The family lives under the [rigkid](https://github.com/rigkid) org: **RigWorks** is the spec, **RigKit** is the reference host. RigKit's `minimal` demo presents the same scene shape family as `examples/minimal-scene.json` — the picture at the top of this page is that document drawn by a third fulfillment, [`tools/render-svg.mjs`](tools/render-svg.mjs).
